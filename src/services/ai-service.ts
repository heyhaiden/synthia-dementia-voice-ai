// Integration points to be implemented in a real version:
/*
1. ElevenLabs API for voice synthesis:
   - Endpoint: https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}
   - Required: API key, voice ID, text

2. OpenAI API for language processing:
   - Endpoint: https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
   - Required: API key, model (e.g., gpt-4), messages

3. Whisper API for speech recognition:
   - Endpoint: https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions
   - Required: API key, audio file, model (e.g., whisper-1)

4. Knowledge base integration:
   - This could be a custom database with healthcare information
   - Or integration with a vector database for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
